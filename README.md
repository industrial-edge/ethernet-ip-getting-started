## Description

### Overview

This tutorial shows how to use the Industrial Edge applications Ethernet IP Connector to establish a connection between an Industrial Edge Device (IED) and a 3rd party PLC that supports **EtherNet/IP**. These PLC variants are supported:

* Allen-Bradley ControlLogix (Rockwell)
* Allen-Bradley CompactLogix (Rockwell)
* Allen-Bradley MicroLogix (Rockwell)
* Allen-Bradley SLC (Rockwell)
* Omron CJ1 Series PLCs
* Omron CJ2 Series PLCs
* Omron CS1 Series PLCs

The Ethernet IP Connector is an application that runs on the individual IED. Connections can be configured using the Common Configurator for Industrial Edge. The connector transfers the value series of selected data points from a PLC to the Databus. From there the data can be used within other Edge apps, e.g. the Flow Creator.

### General task

Here we configure a connection to a CompactLogix PLC using the Ethernet IP Connector. The data is published on the IE Databus. By using the application IE Flow Creator, we fetch the metadata of the Ethernet IP Connector, write some data on the configured tags and read out the new data.

## Configuration

You can find further information about the following steps in the [Configuration](/docs/Installation.md) documentation:

- [Overview](/docs/Installation.md#overview)
- [Install Ethernet IP Connector](/docs/Installation.md#install-ethernet-ip-connector)
- [Configure IE Databus](/docs/Installation.md#configure-ie-databus)
- [Configure Ethernet IP via IIH Configurator](/docs/Installation.md#configure-ethernet-ip-via-iih-configurator)

## Usage

As soon as the Ethernet IP Connector is configured, data can be transfered.

You can find further information about how to handle the data via the IE Flow Creator in the [Usage](/docs/Usage.md) documentation:
